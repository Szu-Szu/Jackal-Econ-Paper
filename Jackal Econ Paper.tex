\section{Tokenomics}

This document will detail the economic structure of Jackal. All amounts are expressed in \$JKL unless otherwise specified.
The \$JKL token is an inflationary token and has four main functions: to be used for governance, storage provider
incentivization, validator incentivization, and access to Jackal Protocol appliactions. 

\section{Governance}

Jackal Protocol is an L1 blockchain on the Cosmos IBC and subject to governance
by the holders of \$JKL. Proposals towards Jackal Protocol cost \$JKL. Governance
of the is consistent with all other IBC governance models otherwise.


\section{Storage Provider Incentivization}

Jackal Protocol is supported by Jackal Storage Providers that supply storage space and support file
retrieval. As this peer-to-peer network is paramount to the success of the Protocol it is vital to incentivize
storage provider to maintain the network. Storage providers are rewarded with \$JKL in return for storing data and participating in Jackal Proof of Persistence.
Of the total block rewards at genesis approximately 60\% is alloocated to storage providers.

\section{Applications}

Along with its flagship storage product, Jackal Protocol consists of decentralized applications.  
Various developement teams may choose to allow access to their application with \$JKL.  ALthough many access methods are available,
using the native token may result in an overal discount.

\noindent The Jackal Protocol is ultimately embedded in the Cosmos Ecosystem. The Protocol reflects this by using other tokens 
as access at genesis. Jackal Protocol applications  Users may choose to use \$ATOM or 
\$USDC to interact with the Protocol. In the future there will be the possibility of adding more tokens to diversify
the Protocol's user base.

\section{Inflation}

The Jackal Protocl is an L1 blockchain on the Cosmos IBC. However, this chain is built differently in the sense that typical
inflationary tokenomics will not be applied here. As storage providers and validators need to be incentivized and various burn
mechanisms will need to be in place, the somewhat unreliability of strict validator inflation would be
suboptimal.
\\~\\
\noindent There is no hard cap on the JKL token supply, making JKL an inflationary token. The primary functions of the JKL token are to 
incentivize the peer-to-peer network and consensus validators. Without block rewards, eventually, there will be no tokens to incentivize 
the network. Lacking this incentive, Jackal can’t have a robust and healthy decentralized protocol. Inflation is distributed through storage providers, 
and validators. 
\\~\\
\noindent The genesis inflation will be approximately 53\% and declining asymptotically annually. With
the initial supply of 100,000,000 this will produce approximately 52,560,000 new \$JKL in the first year. Token
distribution is as follows in the first year. This distribution will change subject to future economic needs of
the protocol determined by governance:

\section{The Airdrop}
The triple snapshot to Juno Network, Cosmos Hub, and Secret Network stakers was completed on 4/9/2022 at 1pm EST and took around 24 hours to come to download all the data. 
The following algorithm and data were used to airdrop amounts for these stakers:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!80}
\color{White}Chain & \color{White}Eligible Wallets \\
\hline
\hline
Secret & 25,694 \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!5}
Juno & 79,473 \\
\hline
Atom & 190,337 \\ 
\hline
\rowcolor{Goldenrod!60}
Total & 295,504 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Airdrop Chain Spread}
\end{center}

\subsection{Airdrop Formula}

The airdrop formula is a clustered stepwise logarithmic function with lower and upper boundaries. We’ll
break this down.
\begin{itemize}
\item Clustered-This means that each chain is broken down into subgroups (or clusters) of tokens by the
amount staked. For example, the minimum amount staked is its own cluster.
\item Stepwise-This means that clusters are not continuous. So, moving from one cluster to another means
that there is an incremental number of tokens moving from one cluster to another.
\item Logarithmic- This function ensures an asymptotic cap when nearing the top of a certain cluster.
\item Lower and upper boundaries- this simply means that there is a minimum amount staked needed to
receive the airdrop as well as a whale cap.
\end{itemize}
The following tables can be used to calculate the approximate amount of \$JKL received when the
corresponding staked amount of each token.

\subsubsection{Secret Network Chain}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!80}
\color{White}Amount of \$SCRT Staked & \color{White}Approximate Amount of \$JKL Received \\
\hline
\hline
$20$ (minimum) & $0.74$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$20<x<100$ & ${(x+\frac{\log x}{2})*\frac{1666666*0.0015}{65153}}$ \\
\hline
$100<x<999.9$ & ${(x+\frac{\log x}{2})*\frac{1666666*0.0016}{65153}}$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$999.9<x<9999.99$ & ${(x+\frac{\log x}{2})*\frac{1666666*0.0017}{65153}}$\\
\hline
$9999.99<x<24769$ & ${(x+\frac{\log x}{2})*\frac{1666666*0.0018}{65153}}$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$24769<x$ & $1221.34$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Example:}

For example, if I have 50 \$SCRT Staked I can expect around ${(50+\frac{\log 50}{2})*\frac{1666666*0.0015}{65153}} \approx1.95$ \$JKL tokens. \footnote[2]{If you are staking on the Jackal Validator you can multiply the airdrop reward by 2.}

\subsubsection{Juno Network Chain}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!80}
\color{White}Amount of \$JUNO Staked & \color{White}Approximate Amount of \$JKL Received \\
\hline
\hline
$10$ (minimum) & $0.76$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$10<x<100$ & ${(x+\log x)*0.07}$ \\
\hline
$100<x<999.9$ & ${(x+\log x)*0.071}$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$999.9<x<9999.99$ & ${(x+\log x)*0.072}$ \\
\hline
$9999.99<x<29159.25$ & ${(x+\log x)*0.073}$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$29159.25<x$ & $2304.42$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Example:}

For example, if I have 50 \$JUNO Staked I can expect around $(50+\log 50)*0.07\approx3.618$ \$JKL tokens. 

\subsubsection{Cosmos Network Chain}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!80}
\color{White}Amount of \$ATOM Staked & \color{White}Approximate Amount of \$JKL Received \\
\hline
\hline
$10$ (minimum) & $ 0.327$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$10<x<100$ & ${(x+\log x)*0.02979}$ \\
\hline
$100<x<999.9$ & ${(x+\log x)*0.03}$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$999.9<x<9999.99$ & ${(x+\log x)*0.0305}$ \\
\hline
$9999.99<x<29999.99$ & ${(x+\log x)*0.0307}$ \\
\hline
\rowcolor{Black!10}
$30000<x$ & $973.54$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Example:}

For example, if I have 50 \$ATOM Staked I can expect around $(50+\log 50)*0.02979\approx1.54$ \$JKL tokens. 

\section{Governance}
Jackal Protocol will be an L1 blockchain on the Cosmos IBC and will be subject to governance by the holders of
\$JKL as well as follow the typical Cosmos SDK governing model. The cost of making a proposal will be 1000
\$JKL. There are 5 different types of proposals.
In accordance with the Cosmos SDK \verb|gov| module as described in the \href{https://v1.cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper}{Cosmos Whitepaper}, governance is
done on-chain. Holders of the tokens can vote on proposals with a 1:1 bias, this means that if I have 10 \$JKL,
my vote is worth ½ the vote of someone who is holding 20 \$JKL. Anyone can submit proposals, these
proposals can be defined into 5 types.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Text Proposal:} A simple proposal that does not alter any source code such as opinion polls.
\item \textbf{Software Upgrade Proposal:} Validators update their software according to the specifications laid out in the
proposal.
\item \textbf{Community Pool Spend Proposal:} If accepted, the proposed amount enters the proposer’s wallet.
\item \textbf{Parameter Change Proposal:} Parameters of the network are changed such as the max validator count.
\item \textbf{Cancel Software Upgrade Proposal:} A vote to cancel any software update in the event that there is an
update set to release that wasn’t proposed in the community governance.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Validators \& Delegations}
During the voting period, any \$JLK holder is permitted to vote on a proposal with their current holding amount
as the voting weight. If a holder chooses not to vote, all of the \$JKL they have delegated is under the control of
the validators they are delegating to.
For example, if I have 20 \$JKL delegated to ValidatorA, and 50 \$JKL delegated to ValidatorB, ValidatorA can
vote with my 20 \$JKL weight, as such ValidatorB can vote with my 50 \$JKL unless I vote on the proposal
myself. In the case I choose to vote, the combined 70 \$JKL is used to vote on whatever my personal choice
was and the 70 \$JKL is removed from their voting power for that particular proposal.

\section{Revenue Distribution}
The \$JKL token is a value accrual token for all decentralized applicatons on the Protocol. Once revenue is generated, \$JKL
tokens are either burned, redistributed, or a combination of both relivant to the economic relevant needs of the
protocol.

\subsection{Genesis Liquidity}
Upon genesis there will be liquidity provided on the Osmosis decentralized exchange to begin trading and arbitrage.
Initially there will be two pools each consisting of a \$JKL trading pair and \$ATOM and \$OSMO
respectively.  

\subsection{The Jackal Swap}
ackal Protocol will include an automated market maker (AMM) which provides three functions.  The primary goal of this AMM
is to avoid the use of a price oracle as we believe that arbitrage methods of the tokens that 
provided on the AMM will have a more accurate price locally on the AMM as well as globally 
across the market with fewer security flaws.  The secondary goal is to provide ease
of user experience on the Jackal platform so that users can swap between assets from the dashboard and wallet. 
The third fuction is to provide arbitrage opportunities above and beyond the use of initial price matching 
so that users have the potential to swap and earn rewards on this platform.
